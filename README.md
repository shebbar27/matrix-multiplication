# matrix-multiplication

In this python script a typical matrix multiplication operation between 2 matrices of dimensions NxN is computed in two different ways:
- using multiple threads for computing part of the results and then finally combine all the results to get the output matrix
- using standard algorithm to compute matricx product in the same main thread and get the output

The executing times of the both the computations are also computed in the python script.
